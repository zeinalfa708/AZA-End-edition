# AZA-End-edition
AZA is a batch assistant that is not usefull. in other word, if you try the program im going to appreciate you but if you don't. use luck.

# Must avoid
1. never type with space ( ) or it will crash!
2. do not type with big letters or the it will not understand

# Edition:
End edition - it's exactly the same (as normal version(Private)), but with very minor changes, and *AND WILL NOT GET A FURTHER UPDATE!*
